## Introduction

Single Page Applications (SPAs) have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their improved user experience and performance. SPAs load a single HTML page and dynamically update its content using JavaScript, resulting in faster navigation and reduced server load. While SPAs offer many benefits, they can be complex to build and maintain, requiring a significant amount of client-side JavaScript code.
