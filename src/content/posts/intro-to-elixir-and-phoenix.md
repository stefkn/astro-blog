## About Elixir

Elixir is a functional, concurrent, general-purpose programming language that runs on the Erlang virtual machine (BEAM). It was created by ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· JosÃ© Valim, a former member of the Ruby on Rails core team, and first released in 2011. Elixir is known for its scalability, fault-tolerance, and performance, making it an excellent choice for building distributed systems and web applications. It runs an older, more mature language called [Erlang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language)) under the hood, and shares many of its features, such as lightweight processes, message passing, and pattern matching. With regards to types, [Elixir is strong-dynamic language](https://thinkingelixir.com/elixir-in-the-type-system-quadrant/) kind of like Python and Ruby.

## About Phoenix

[Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) is a web development framework written in Elixir that follows the model-view-controller (MVC) pattern. It's fully batteries-included, meaning it comes with everything you need to build a modern web application: a built-in web server, database integration with Ecto (kind of an ORM, analogous to Rails' ActiveRecord), and a powerful templating engine. Phoenix is known for its speed, performance, and developer-friendly features, such as real-time communication via WebSockets and channels. It's a great choice for building high-performance, real-time web applications.

## Why Elixir and Phoenix?

Elixir and Phoenix offer several advantages over other programming languages and frameworks, including:
