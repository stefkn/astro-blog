I've been a big fan of Isaac Asimov since almost as long as I can remember–I never thought he was the bestest writerer ever, but the ideas in his novels are what make them great; highly conceptual notions like the Laws of Robotics, "Psychohistory" (we'll get to that) and the ethical implications of sentient, thinking machines. The [list of things the man thought of](http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/AuthorTotalAlphaList.asp?AuNum=4) before they existed is insane. He even basically forecasted the [industrial application of a modern LLM as an applicance.](http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/content.asp?Bnum=3936) Also, Will Smith was cool af in _I, Robot_ even if the plot was predicatable – and the robots all looking like G3 iMacs is just the icing on the cake.[^irobot]

That being said, I have regrettably never attempted to tackle his larger volumes, the Foundation series being probably the biggest of his oeuvre. Luckily my favourite fruit company has me covered on that front too, as they've spent a lot of money getting some great actors[^foundation-actors] together to make a _UHD, HDR10, Spatial Audio_ TV show so I don't have to read any of those huge flattened dead tree "book" things. Brilliant. Thanks, [_Tim Apple_.](https://youtu.be/XHVxm12NbrY?si=gmC17UXItzu01iuB)

## About Psychohistory

One of the big ideas from the Foundation series is the concept of [Psychohistory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychohistory_(fictional_science)). Roughly speaking, this is a fictional branch of mathematics which is concerned with the prediction of future events on a civilizational scale, kind of like how statistics can predict variables across a large sample population. On a micro scale, each variable is random and unpredictable, but gather a large enough sample and plot them all on a histogram and heyo, they follow a Gaussian distribution.

The author John Kessel[^kessel] describes it like this:
> “I studied physics as an undergrad, and basically what [Asimov] is doing is taking classical thermodynamics and applying it to human behavior. In thermodynamics, you can’t predict what one atom is going to do, but if you have several billion atoms in a contained box, you can predict—very precisely—if you raise the temperature, exactly what the effect on pressure is going to be, things like that. He’s basically saying if you have enough human beings—you have 100 million worlds, all inhabited by human beings—that psychohistory can predict the mass behavior of human beings, without being able to predict any individual human being’s behavior. That’s a cool idea.”

This video essay does a _great_ deep dive into the idea:

Stage right, enters an older businessman, dressed in a cardigan and slacks, with messy silver hair. At a glance, the uninformed wouldn't have the slightest inkling that they were now in the presence of a titan of American finance. Ray Dalio is many things: a billionaire; a Chief Investment Officer and founder at one of the world's biggest hedge funds, [Bridgewater Associates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgewater_Associates); a member of the [Council on Foreign Relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_on_Foreign_Relations); one of the people who successfully anticipated*[^2008-prediction] the [Global Financial Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007%E2%80%932008_financial_crisis) of 2008, and no doubt many more highly impressive things.

Perhaps more impressive is that he claims to have discovered a repeating cycle in history that determines the rising and falling of the current hegemon of each era's global order. He calls this _"The Changing World Order"_ and he's made a cool YouTube video essay series to sell the book that he wrote about it. Here it is:

<iframe class="yt-embed" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xguam0TKMw8?si=RF0pWhdOMucq9byk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

There's _a lot_ to unpack here.

First off, the man's a literal deca-billionaire. He doesn't need to sell his books. So, what's all this about? Is this a post-midlife crisis vanity project, an exercise in ego-inflation or is he genuinely trying to help us understand the world better? It's a well worn path for the rich and powerful to enter into the world of philanthropy; Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, and Mark Zuckerberg are all examples of this–but this isn't [Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/), or even the [Giving Pledge](https://givingpledge.org/). He is _selling_ the book, after all.

There are also a number of puzzling omissions. Additionally, a number of non-trivial, "black swan" events don't seem to fit neatly within the framework of cycles that Dalio describes. A third major issue is that, being obsessed with the global order, Dalio seems to ignore the fact that the world is made up of individual nations, each with their own unique histories, cultures, and political systems.

<!-- For example, the book doesn't mention the [Great Depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression) or the [World Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War) as contributing factors to the rise and fall of empires. It's odd that a book about the rise and fall of empires would not mention the two most significant events in the last century that led to the rise and fall of empires.  -->

## The Changing World Order Thesis

_Disclaimer of the highest order: I am not a subject matter expert in, well, anything really._ I read books and watch video essays that help me feel like I know what I'm talking about. So, with that in mind, here's my broad summary of Dalio's thesis:

- The world order is a continuous, cyclical process, and the current world order is coming to an end.
  - World orders have an expected lifespan of what Dalio calls the "Big Cycle" which is about 75-100 years.
  - Previous "Big Cycles" include the Dutch Empire, the British Empire, and, presently, the American Empire.
    - The hegemon's currency is also the world's reserve currency. Such as the Gilder, the Pound Sterling, and the US Dollar. This allows the hegemon to print money (Quantative Easing) and borrow more money at a lower rate than other nations.[^other-factors]
  - Shifts in productivity, education, and technology which affect a nation's military and economic power are the key drivers of these cycles.
- The next world order will be defined by [China](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ik51943WQE) as the global hegemon.
- The transition between world orders is a time of great upheaval and conflict.

There is a precedent for this kind of thinking. Most recently, the [Thucydides Trap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides_Trap) is a concept devised by political scientist [Graham Allison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Allison) which uses the analogy of ancient Greece and Sparta as a lens through which to view US-China relations.[^thucydides] The rough idea is that the established power will always seek to maintain its dominance, while the rising power will always seek to challenge it. This latter section of Dalio's thesis could be considered part of a genre of _"foreign power is threatening United States' hegemony"_ literature[^other-lit] that has been popular since the end of the Cold War – perhaps reflecting a chronic anxiety about the America's place in the world. After all, when you're Number One[^number-one], the only way you can go is down.

## Parallels to Psychohistory

In Foundation, Hari Seldon is exiled to the backwater planet of Terminus by the Galactic Empire because he insists that the Empire is about to fall. He predicts that the Empire will collapse and that the galaxy will be plunged into a dark age that will last for roughly 30,000 years. He also claims that the dark age can be shortened to 1,000 years if he can take certain mitigating steps, including the establishment of a "Foundation" to preserve knowledge and technology.

Stop me if you've heard this one before. Dalio's thesis is essentially the same thing, but with the United States instead of the Galactic Empire and the Foundation.[^usa-empire] Towards the end of the book it even moves on to strategies for surviving and thriving during the transition, just as is the purpose of Seldon's Foundation.

I don't think Dalio claims to have come up with this thesis entirely independently, which is good, because there's a lot of existing academic literature on exactly what he's describing here. In fact, the idea of the birth, life, zenith and collapse of societites occurring in a cyclic loop can even be traced back to the real [Thucydides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides) in ancient Greece and [Sima Qian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sima_Qian) in ancient China.[^sima-qian-thucydides] In fact, a cyclic alternation of dualities is especially compatible with the [Daoist](https://arc.net/l/quote/ltdnbbtq) worldview of Yin (Dark) and Yang (Light).

Parallel to this, the "social cycle" is a concept that has been around for a long time, and is a key part of the work of [Pitirim Sorokin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitirim_Sorokin), a fascinating Russian-American sociologist who wrote extensively on the subject. If Psychohistory could be considered the macroeconomics of human civilization, then the social cycle could be considered the microeconomics, as it is more concerned with individual values and beliefs and how they impact a society collectively.[^sorokin]

It's difficult not to think of Dalio's work as a simplified repackaging of some of these existing concepts. This isn't necessarily a bad thing—after all, the Foundation series is itself essentially a repackaging of the fall of the Roman Empire, but with spaceships. But it speaks to Asimov's genius that he incorporates such complex and high-concept ideas into a sci-fi novel that could have just been about a collapsing galatic empire. Asimov asks, _"would the fall of the Roman Empire have been different if someone had called it?"_ while Dalio says, _"America is on its way out. I'm calling it."_ These are quite different positions.

## Conclusion

There's a really popular lecture series at the Stanford Business School called ["The View From the Top"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxq_lXOUlvQAwaY_9K4ZFH9Xdar9WzCaL) where they invite CEOs and big shots to wax lyrical about their careers and the state of the world. The title of the series alludes to the idea that when you're at the "top", you can see everything. You have the best view. You can even see glimpses of the future. You're a deca-billionaire. You own riches comparable to the GDP of small nations. You have a unique perspective on the world that _no one else has._

Ray Dalio is obviously incredibly intelligent–and there are some well presented and logical arguments for the Changing World Order thesis. But financier Dalio seems to forget the old investing adage, _"past performance does not guarantee future results"._ The world is a complex and chaotic place, and it's difficult to predict what will happen next. The fall of the American Empire is not a foregone conclusion, and the [rise of China is similarly not inevitable.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=It1xr6FQcAo) A very compelling argument could be made for an alternative future where there is no single global hegemon, but rather a vague, multipolar world order defined by "blocks" of nations with similar interests–a world where the US and China are both powerful, but neither is dominant.

To this point, it's interesting to learn what happens in the later books in the Foundation series:

> one of the things I like is that by the fourth (?) book, it turns out that the entire Seldon Plan had failed entirely and it was the Second Foundation touching things up as it goes along. Psychohistory failed, it was too error prone for the Foundation to do what it was meant to do. good stuff

Yet it can be undermined by the eventual existence of a nonhuman, just as much as an ideal gas is disrupted by an electromagnetically active vapor within it.  Asimov again sets up a plausible premise and attacks it from all angles.

Asimov isn't saying psychohistory is real, to the contrary, he is using it as a thought experiment. Meanwhile, an American deca-billionaire is insisting it pretty much _is_ real; not only is it real, but it says America is done for. To me, this feels a bit like the biggest investors, leading researchers and biggest tech firms insisting that AI is a phenomenally dangerous, civilizational threat while also investing billions in AI research.[^ai-research] They stand to gain the most from everyone believing that the technology is more powerful and dangerous than it actually is. Similarly, Dalio stands to gain from everyone believing that the world order is changing as he describes, and that he knows how best to navigate it.

_This doesn't necessarily mean that he's wrong, but it's worth considering._

Anyway, here's an advert for CashApp with Kendrick Lamar featuring Ray Dalio. Enjoy:

[^irobot]: [_"I DID NOT MURDER HIM!"_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCveNH0GZ2U) _...also the script was quite randomly sexist at times? Asimov's ideas may be eternal, but 2004 Hollywood scriptwriting has not aged well._
[^foundation-actors]: Jared Harris has been in lot of amazing stuff but most recently the [Chernobyl](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/chernobyl) HBO series was excellent. Also, Lee Pace is in a show called [Halt and Catch Fire](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/halt_and_catch_fire) which is about the development of the PC and the IBM PC "clone wars" which is a must-watch for any tech nerd.
[^2008-prediction]: *While not specifically being known for calling it out like Michael Burry, Joseph Stiglitz, Steve Eisman and Nouriel Roubini (among others), Bridgewater Associates fared remarkably well during the 2008 crisis due to its defensive investment posture and its balance books being sufficiently hedged against the crisis. This earned Dalio a reputation for having "anticipated" the crash among the investment banking community.
[^other-lit]: Before China, it was Japan. Books like [Japan as Number One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_as_Number_One:_Lessons_for_America) and [The Coming War with Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Coming_War_with_Japan) are fascinating retrospective reads now.
[^number-one]: A Lazy Town reference? In _my_ blog post? It's more likely than you think.
[^thucydides]: This is a controversial concept in international relations theory to say the least, with many scholars arguing that it is a gross oversimplification, and that _"conflicts between city-states in a backwater Eurasian promontory 2,400 years ago are an unreliable guide to modern geopolitics—and they neglect a vast span of world history that may be far more relevant."_ (source: ['Oh God, Not the Peloponnesian War Again' by James Paler in Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/07/28/oh-god-not-the-peloponnesian-war-again/))
[^kessel]: [Source: ‘Foundation’ Has One of the Best Sci-Fi Concepts Ever - WIRED Magazine](https://arc.net/l/quote/kexcpysv)
[^usa-empire]: Obviously, the US is not the Galactic Empire, but it is the current global hegemon. The US has the world's largest economy, the world's most powerful military by a mile, and arguably the world's most influential culture. 
[^sima-qian-thucydides]: BAI, Chun Xiao. “The Cyclic Views of the Human Condition in Thucydides’ Archaeology and Sima Qian’s Preface to Historical Records.” CHS Research Bulletin 5, no. 1 (2016). http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:hlnc.essay:BaiX.The_Cyclic_Views_of_the_Human_Condition.2016
[^sorokin]: Specifically, Sorokin categorised social change into three types: ideational, sensate, and idealistic. Ideational societies are characterised by a focus on the spiritual and the metaphysical, sensate societies are characterised by a focus on the material and the physical, and idealistic societies are characterised by a focus on the moral and the ethical. Sorokin believed that societies moved through these stages in a cyclical pattern, with each stage lasting around 200-300 years.
[^other-factors]: It's odd that _colonialism and slavery_ are not mentioned as a contributing factor to the rise of each empire here.
